# Kuilima Estates West Vacation Rental

A deadsimple website for a Hawaiian vacation rental, inspired by [Dead Simple Sites](https://deadsimplesites.com/).

## Setup

The site currently has placeholder divs where images should go. To add your images:

1. Replace each placeholder div with an img tag
2. Example: Change this:
   ```html
   <div class="w-full h-[600px] bg-gray-100 flex items-center justify-center">
       <p class="text-gray-400">Add your main aerial photo here</p>
   </div>
   ```
   To this:
   ```html
   <img src="your-image.jpg" alt="Aerial view of Kuilima Estates West" class="w-full h-[600px] object-cover">
   ```

3. Put your images in the same folder as `index.html` or in an `assets` folder

## Running

Simply open `index.html` in a browser. No build process needed.

## Design Philosophy

This site follows deadsimple design principles:
- Minimal animations
- No scroll jacking
- Clean typography
- Focus on content
- Simple, direct presentation
